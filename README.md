# SpyCode

SpyCode is a custom software built in MatlabÂ©, developed for processing multi-channel electrophysiological signals. The software provides a working environment able to perform efficient data management and processing of MEA signal, since it incorporates a very rich repertoire of standard and advanced signal analysis tools.
