%EXPANDD Expand integer vector to matrix occurance table
% 
%       A = expandd(x,m)
% 
% The vector x containing just integers > 0 (e.g. numeric
% labels) is expanded to a matrix A with size (length(x),m)
% such that A(i,j) = 1 if x(i) = j and A(i,j) = 0 if x(i) = j
% 
% As a result sum(A) is a frequency table of j in x. max(A) is
% a 0-1 vector indicating the occurance of some j in x.
% find(max(A)) gives all j that occur in x.
